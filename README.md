<!-- INFORMATION -->

#### About
GS++ (GameSense++) is a private Minecraft forge "utility born" for anarchy-related servers such as 2b2t.<br>
This project was started by TechAle after gamesense got discontinued.<br>

#### Questions
* Why is this repository public? If you see this repository is because either you are a member
of gs++ gs++ got leaked and i decided that, if gs++ ever got leaked, i will make 
the source code public<br>
* I have an issue with gs++, can you help me? Unless you are a gs++ member, you wont get any support from me.
Remember that this is a private client that is different from open source<br>
* How can i get gs++? For be a member of gs++ you must get vouched by at least 3 gs++' members, 
and you can make the request by asking 1 of the gs++ users of starting a vouch for you.
Considerate that if you spam to get vouched u wont get it 100%, we have a channel where we post people that beg for the client.<br>
* Why continuing as private client? I decided to continue developing gamesense as private because well, people are annoying.
The experience of gamesense was enough for me to make me say "No, never". So i decided to reserve my new updates
to only few people that have a little bit of brain.

#### gs++ Credits
I think it's the duty of a developer saying if he took inspiration / took some piece of code from another client.
* How customchat is implemented for overriding  minecraft's chat (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-chat)

#### GameSense Credits
***Check specific class files for full credits.***
This client started out based off of FINZ0's Osiris, which in turn was based off of 086's KAMI. 
Without these projects, GameSense would not exist so a lot of credit is due to them for their work.

This client also implements the ClickGUI using PanelStudio: https://github.com/lukflug/PanelStudio/.
If you believe that we are using your code and credits are not properly given, please message GooberTown#7384 on Discord.
